### Who am I?

I am Amarnath, a student attending university. I took up programming as I always found the science behind computers and computational intelligence very interesting.

I have a couple of repositories here on GitHub, feel free to check them out. I am always open to feedback and suggestions. I usually just go to school and come home, but me and my friends enjoy playing basketball from time to time. I enjoy playing video games and I run a pseudo-server at home (just a 12 year old laptop running a couple of services).
