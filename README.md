# Hello there.

## So you clicked on my profile. Who in the doofenshmirtz is this guy?

### Formal/Academic

My name is Amarnath, and I am a currently 16 year old (full time dual enrolled highschool)[https://www.fauhigh.fau.edu/]

And yes I am the little kid in the dark blue shirt with glasses in the bottom right. The photo was taken **4** years ago ok I was in 7th grade bud....

  Anyways I am right now just some amateur just enjoying the benefits of Arch Linux on EndeavourOS. I use Hyprland as my tiling window manager, and am currently configuring my eww bar. I have a dotfiles repository named `theshlawg` which you can head over to see my dots. 
  I am a cofounder and board member / leader of an Fau Highschool programming club where me and a couple friends lead the advanced division of the club. I would put a link to my resume here or something but turns out I HAVE 0 currencies and therefore no money to buy a cool url or even host my own web server. So thanks github for that (free one)[https://jeebuscrossaint.github.io/] 
  In the more technical less just "oh this guy knows how to write a bash script and stuff hehe" sense I like learning, exploring, and destroying my home network using **pentesting tools**. I have used Kali Linux, and BlackArch Linux, and so have repeatedly done too much to my home network. I find pentesting incredibly interesting and have always wanted to partake in a whole CTF pentesting event. For those casuals this is basically actual hacking and a portion of cybersecurity. Not your dumb IP grabbing rickrolls. If you don't believe me the guy behind me in my calculus class called me a hacker just because my terminal configuration is green text and then I installed packages from the AUR and bro was frightened.

My current IDE is Visual Studio Code Insiders and I also use vim/nvim ***on the occasion***, but my usage of VSC has drastically decreased recently due to my enjoyment of `vim/nvim` and text editor `nano`.
I am currently learning C++ and have learned a good bit of C already, and I have messed the most with `bash`. 
Learning about AI and web development in depth is also a something that I want to do, but I am really busy right now as I am taking 5 classes this semester.
